<h2>About HistoryForge</h2>

<p>Interested in understanding the history of our community? Or in helping to develop and create narratives that will give you and others a new appreciation for the people and processes that produced present-day Ithaca and Tompkins County? What would that require?</p>
<p>We think that, first, it requires a sense of place. Do you really know where you live? Does your house have a story? How has your neighborhood changed? With our help and your own imagination you can develop that sense of place. We have designed HistoryForge  to excite your imagination by using historical maps in a new and powerful way. We’re going to show you maps that move with your thoughts; maps that can uncover the past with a click.</p>
<p>With your new-found sense of place you’ll be ready to explore HistoryForge’s amazing collection of information about the people, buildings, businesses and human geography of Ithaca and Tompkins County. We are tapping the staggering but underutilized resources of the US Census schedules, city directories, historic photographs and building narratives and eventually the directly contributed information of the community itself and connecting that information to the map.</p>
<p>HistoryForge is a project of The History Center in Tompkins County, New York. It’s  being developed at these early stages by a team consisting of David Furber (systems analyst and web developer from GORGES) and Bob Kibbee (former Map and Geospatial Librarian at Cornell University), and by Kristin Yarnell, our indefatigable intern, a student at TC3. Bob and David are both History Center trustees. Valuable input has also been provided by Christine O’Malley from Historic Ithaca.</p>
<p>The seamless Sanborn Fire Insurance Atlas of Ithaca from 1910 is the broad canvas for HistoryForge.  It was constructed by Kristin using MapWarper, an open-source georectifying service customized by David to meet the  Forge’s special needs. Want to explore? The project on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dfurber/historyforge">dfurber/historyforge</a>. Based on work by Tim Waters: tim at geothings dot net ; blog: <a href="http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://thinkwhere.wordpress.com</a>.</p>
<p>David has built the software for building descriptions and census records while Bob and Kristin fill the buckets with data. Development and refinement continues as time and resources allow, with a short-term goal of a functioning proof-of-concept site as a basis for grant proposals that would fund the development of a full-featured open-sourced prototype. The HistoryForge prototype could be adapted by any community with historical maps and untapped information resources.</p>
<p>Please explore HistoryForge , We would be interested in your thoughts and reactions. A call for data entry volunteers will be going out soon. Keep HistoryForge in mind — you could be making Ithaca history!</p>
