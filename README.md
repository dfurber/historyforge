# HistoryForge

This project is a fork of MapWarper (timwaters/mapwarper). Go there for setup instructions. Also megathanks to Tim Waters and the New York Public Library for sponsoring and sticking with that awesome project!

HistoryForge is built on a base of MapWarper because we wanted to use the ability to upload historical maps, rectify them to the real map, combine them together, and display them along with historical information about buildings and people.

The intended use is for a local historical society to create a combination map library, building, resident, and photo database.

It is in a stage of rapid growth right now. Are you a Rails or JavaScript developer in Ithaca who would like to help out a good cause, please let me know at furberd at gmail dot com. One caveat is that there is no test suite. MapWarper doesn't have one, and itself only runs in a finicky Ubuntu environment. I hope to backfill as this project takes off, but have focused on features first since it is a time-limited labor of love.
